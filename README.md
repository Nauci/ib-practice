This is your first ever practice project! Today, you will be dragging and dropping labels and making an app about Buildschool and your classmates.

## Screen 1. 
For this screen, use the AViewController.xib file.
Mock: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/14730748/306299669

*Step One*  
Use labels to create the text:  
Buildschool  
My name is _ (use your real name!)  
I'm at Buildschool to  
and to  

*Step Two*  
Then, use buttons to create the text:  
Learn  
Build

Make sure they are aligned the way they look in the mock!


## Screen 2. 
For this screen use the BViewController.xib file.
Mock: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/14730748/306299669

This is your Goals screen!  

*Step One*  
Create a label that says "My Goals This Semester"  

*Step Two*  
Drag buttons below this label. One per goal. Think of some things you want to achieve this semester and use these as your own button text!


## Screen 3. 
For this screen, use the CViewController.xib file.
Mock: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/14730748/306299668

This is your Classmates screen!  

*Step One*  
Create a label that says "My Classmates"  

*Step Two*  
For each class make two labels.   
  The first says their name and is black.  
  The second says one of their interests and is gray. 
  
*Step Three*   
Pick a partner (groups of 3 is also ok!) and create the few labels:  
"My first partner this semester is" (gray)  
"partner_name" (black)  
  
*Step Four*  
Follow along the mocks and fill out each answer with the appropriate classmate.    
Hint: this *might* involve talking to your classmates a bit :)
