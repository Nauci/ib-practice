This is your first ever practice project! Today, you will be dragging and dropping labels and making an app about Buildschool and your classmates.

Screen 1. For this screen, use the AViewController.xib file.
Mock: zpl.io/2jkel5x

- Use labels to create the text:
Buildschool
My name is _ (use your real name!)
I'm at Buildschool to
and to

- Then, use buttons to create the text:
Learn
Build

Make sure they are aligned the way they look in the mock!


Screen 2. For this screen use the BViewController.xib file.
Mock: zpl.io/be1rgWP

This is your Goals screen!
- Create a label that says "My Goals This Semester"
- Drag buttons below this label. One per goal. Think of some things you want to achieve this semester and use these as your own button text!


Screen 3. For this screen, use the CViewController.xib file.
Mock: zpl.io/aM5D4jN

This is your Classmates screen!
- Create a label that says "My Classmates"
- For each class make two labels. 
  The first says their name and is black.
  The second says one of their interests and is gray.
- Pick a partner (groups of 3 is also ok!) and create the few labels:
  "My first partner this semester is" (gray)
  <name of your partner> (black)
- Follow along the mocks and fill out each answer with the appropriate classmate.
  Hint: this *might* involve talking to your classmates a bit :)
